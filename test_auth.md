# 🧪 Testing User Creation Flow

## The Issue
Users aren't being added to the database because you're already authenticated with an old session that was created before we implemented the database user creation feature.

## The Solution
You need to do a **fresh Google OAuth login** to trigger the user creation code.

## Testing Steps

### 1. First, check current users:
```bash
./list_db.sh | grep -A 5 "👥 USERS:"
```

### 2. Go to your browser and visit:
```
http://localhost:8080/auth/logout
```
OR
```
http://localhost:8080/login
```

### 3. Log in again with Google OAuth

### 4. Watch the logs for our new debugging messages:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log
```

You should see messages like:
- `🔄 Database available, attempting to create/update user for: your@email.com`
- `📝 Creating new user for: your@email.com`
- `✅ Successfully created user your@email.com with DB ID: 1`

### 5. Verify the user was created:
```bash
./list_db.sh | grep -A 10 "👥 USERS:"
```

## Expected Result
After logging in, you should see:
- User creation logs in `logs/app.log`
- Your user appears in the database with:
  - Name from Google profile
  - Email address
  - Google ID
  - Profile picture URL
  - Database ID

## If it still doesn't work:
Check these potential issues:
1. Database connection (should see ✅ Connected to PostgreSQL)
2. Google OAuth credentials (check GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID in .env)
3. Session middleware configuration
4. GORM errors in the logs
