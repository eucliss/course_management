  "Review": "Bath Country Club is an absolute gem of a course.\n\nAlthough the course doesnt appear like it has that great of a thing going, this course is one of my favorites. This is a classic locals course with a tiny, somewhat shitty, club house, not a whole lot of merch, no turn dogs, and an average grass range. The people that work here are always awesome and chill and tee times are very lenient.\n\nThe course is always in great shape, fairways are tight, rough is long, and greens are always nice. The bunkers here are pretty shitty so I typically dont hit out of them. The layout is awesome, its such a chill course to play and scorable. Its just super enjoyable to play and the vibe is very chill, overall an awesome experience for cheap. \n\nGreat course to walk.",
