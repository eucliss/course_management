  "review": "Augusta National is the pinnacle of golf course excellence. The pristine fairways and lightning-fast greens are maintained to perfection. Amen Corner (holes 11-13) offers one of the most challenging and beautiful stretches in golf. The azaleas in bloom during The Masters create an unmatched aesthetic. The famous pimento cheese sandwiches and immaculate facilities add to the mystique. Walking these hallowed grounds, you can feel the history of the game - from Tiger's chip-in on 16 to Jack's charge in '86. The course demands precision, strategy, and nerves of steel, especially around the treacherous greens.",
